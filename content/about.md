## hello

My name is ≈Åukasz, but I am mostly using Hauleth over the internet.

I am working mostly in Erlang/Elixir as a remote developer currently hired at
[Remote](https://remote/com).

Except that I am part of the [Erlang Ecosystem Foundation Observability WG][eef-o-wg]
where we are trying to improve observability features in Erlang ecosystem.
